<!An about us section to describe >

We are excited to announce the formation of a new student club at Queen’s University: the 
Merlin Neurotechnology Club. We’re a group of undergraduate and graduate students who are 
passionate about the development of a neurotechnology community at Queen’s.

<b>What is neurotechnology?</b>

Neurotechnology is a vast interdisciplinary field that encompasses any kind of technological 
development involving the brain. This includes imaging, stimulation, invasive devices, and even 
genetic and cellular techniques. Our club will focus on <b>BCIs</b>: brain-computer interfaces. 
We’re really excited about developing technology that allows direct communication between brains 
and computers. Yep. We want to control computers with the power of thought, and we’re not alone!
In the past 6 months, both Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have announced major BCI development 
projects, leading to an industry explosion and a race to design the most functional neurotechnology.

<b>Why is it called “Merlin” Neurotech?</b>

The founders of this club were heavily influenced by 
<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> 
awesome write-up by Wait But Why. The author jokes that the goal of Elon Musk’s Neuralink 
initiative is to build a “wizard hat for the brain,” and we’ve decided that our goals 
are no less lofty. As powerful as he is, “Gandalf Neurotech” just didn’t have the same ring to it.

<b>How do you plan to develop this club?</b>

Fortunately for us, a blueprint exists. <a href="http://neurotechx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
NeuroTechX</a> is a non-profit organization that aims to provide a framework for the development of an 
international neurotechnology community. They are working to provide neurotechnology enthusiasts from 
all disciplines and all corners of the globe with the knowledge, resources, and connections to dive 
into this exciting field. They have a very active online community, open-source coding and development 
platforms, and industry partnerships- there are currently NeuroTechX chapters in 18 cities and 11 
universities worldwide! They will be providing us with commercial EEG (electroencephalography) devices 
to begin recording brain signals; we plan to start by reproducing some simple EEG experiments, then 
we’ll move on to more exciting projects as our skills develop.

<b>How can I get involved?</b>

We’re currently still in the process of officially ratifying our club with Queen’s, and while we get 
the ball rolling we’re hoping to keep things small. That said, if you’re keen to be a part of our 
club, or if you have any questions about what we do, shoot us an email at 
<a href="mailto:mnc@clubs.queensu.ca">mnc@clubs.queensu.ca</a>. We’ll also be posting updates on our 
projects on this blog as we start wizard hat development, so check back here for more info!
